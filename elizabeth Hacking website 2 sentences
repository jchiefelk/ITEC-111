<h1>Two Sentences from "Wonderhowto.com"</h1>
<h2>I play alot of Fornite and GTA, Destiny, Nazi Zombies in COD, Last of Us and Evil Within,
 but it is so annoying waiting for the free DLC of "Save The World" for Fornite.
 Patience is a virtue and we're lucky its coming out for free soon, but anyways I learned that there are multiple ways to gain free "V-Bucks" by 
comleteing certain missions in "Save The World" mode instead of PvP/PvE mode.</h2>
