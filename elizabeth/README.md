<h1>Metasploit</h1>

<p>
Metasploit has been developing internet tools for decades and have made it to the top 15 when it comes to Internet Hacking Tools. They are also open-sourced and have probably the nicest, aethestically pleasing website on the list so far. There isn't really any synopsis on entirely what they do but from what I can make out on their website they have some diverse applications, downloadables, documents and other tools for penetration testing.  https://www.metasploit.com/contribute
